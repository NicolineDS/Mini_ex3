My program: https://rawgit.com/NicolineDS/Mini_ex3/master/mini_3.1/empty-example/index.html

My throbber is a man rotating around the world. It symbolises how the Internet connects the individual to the rest of the world in just a matter of seconds. 
I found the coding of the trhobber to be very difficult because there were a lot of new codes to incorporate into the program, and to make them all work together was a challenge. I got some help form one of my classmates to make my man rotate because I did not know where to start and where to put the different lines of codes. After that I got the image of the world to be in the centre of the canvas with some help from one of my Instructors.
Some of the time-related codes I used were ‘function preload’ and  ‘push and pop’. I used function preload to make the image of the world appear when the page loads. I used ‘push and pop’ to isolate the ‘rotate-function’ to the man so he would be the only object rotating. 
I think throbbers are made as a universal symbol so the user of a digital artifact knows what the digital artifact is in the process of doing. It is easier to make a universal symbol that symbolise what a digital artifact is doing instead of explaining how much data the artifact is loading and searching through. It has become a symbol of waiting and a way of showing the user that the machine is working but the user has to wait.
